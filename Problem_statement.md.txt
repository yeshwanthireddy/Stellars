# Project: PhishGuard - Real-Time Phishing Detection System

## Goal

To build an intelligent system that detects phishing emails and malicious links in real time and warns users before they open unsafe content.

PhishGuard provides both browser-based automatic protection and a desktop-based manual scanning tool to improve online security.


## Problem Statement

Phishing attacks are one of the most common cyber threats, where attackers use fake emails and malicious links to steal sensitive information.

Users often cannot identify such threats, especially when attackers use shortened URLs and fake domains. Existing solutions either detect threats too late or fail to provide clear warnings.

There is a need for a real-time, intelligent, and user-friendly phishing detection system.

## Key Features

- Real-time browser extension for link interception  
- Instant popup warning system  
- Multi-agent AI-based analysis  
- Detection of shortened and fake URLs  
- Desktop application for manual scanning  
- Hybrid AI and rule-based detection  
- Fast response time (< 1 second)

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- JavaScript
- HTML / CSS
- Chrome & Edge Extension API

### Backend
- Python 3.10
- Flask (REST API)

### AI & Analysis
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression
- Heuristic Rule Engine

### Desktop Application
- Tkinter (GUI)

### Development Tools
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub
- Virtual Environment (venv)
- Windows OS

## How It Works

1. User clicks on a link in email or webpage
2. Browser extension intercepts the click
3. Link is sent to Flask backend
4. Multiple agents analyze the content
5. Risk score is calculated
6. Popup warning is displayed
7. User decides whether to continue

## Future Enhancements

- Mobile application support  
- Cloud-based threat intelligence  
- Deep learning-based detection models  
- Enterprise email security plugins  
- Centralized phishing database
